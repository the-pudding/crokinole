That opens up more complicated (but more exciting to watch) scenarios since going for a 20 may not be the best strategic choice."},{"type":"text","value":"But one thing remains clear; more skilled players are able to keep the number of discs on the board to a minimum and make open 20s at a higher rate, making it far more likely to see a perfect round when two great players go against each other."},{"type":"text","value":"And no, Crokinole isn’t an Olympic sport.
